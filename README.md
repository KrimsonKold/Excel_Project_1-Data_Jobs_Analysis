# Excel DA Project 1: Data Jobs
Hello, this is my very first Excel project on learning Data Analytics. I made two different project on a dataset that contains a lot of detail about data jobs. The first one, I designed a dashboard for mapping out a lot of data jobs out there, while the other one, I try to dig deeper into data jobs salary based on different things, such as countries and skills.

## Main Data Dashboard
This dashboard was created for job seekers to help them find an adequate salary compensation for their desired jobs.
